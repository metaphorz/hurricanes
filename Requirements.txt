# Multiple Hurricane Tracks Visualization Requirements

## Project Overview
This project creates an interactive visualization of multiple hurricane tracks using Python and Folium. The visualization displays the paths of seven significant hurricanes (Irene 2011, Andrew 1992, Ian 2022, Ida 2021, Milton 2024, Idalia 2023, and Helene 2024) with color-coded intensity segments, detailed tooltips, popups, and an information panel.

## Requirements Implemented

1. Data Processing:
   - Successfully extracts data from the provided CSV file (ibtracs.NA.list.v04r01.csv)
   - Implemented a separate data extraction script (extract_hurricane_data.py) to create a smaller, optimized dataset
   - Reduced dataset size by 99.58% (from 126,838 rows to 537 rows)
   - Filters records matching each hurricane name and season year
   - Extracts and processes fields: NAME, LAT, LON, USA_SSHS (Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale), USA_WIND (wind speed), and ISO_TIME
   - Sorts each hurricane's track points chronologically by ISO_TIME
   - Handles missing or non-numeric values appropriately
   - Fixed NumPy data type serialization for reliable JSON conversion

2. Visualization Features:
   - Creates an interactive map showing all seven hurricane tracks simultaneously
   - Displays each track as a continuous set of line segments without loops
   - Colors line segments according to hurricane intensity (Saffir-Simpson category)
   - Adds markers for key points (start, middle, end) with detailed popup information
   - Implements reliable popups on both line segments and markers using IFrame and GeoJSON
   - Implements tooltips on track segments showing storm name, date/time, wind speed, and location
   - Includes a legend explaining the hurricane category colors
   - Features a scrollable hurricane summary panel to accommodate all seven hurricanes
   - Optimized layout with non-overlapping information panels
   - Features a persistent information panel listing all hurricanes with their peak intensities

3. User Interface:
   - Provides intuitive navigation with hover tooltips and click popups
   - Includes clear instructions for interacting with the visualization
   - Automatically adjusts map bounds to show all hurricane tracks
   - Displays a title and legend for easy reference

4. Output:
   - Saves the visualization as an HTML file (multiple_hurricane_tracks_final.html)
   - Can be viewed in any modern web browser
   - No external dependencies required for viewing

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- folium
- datetime

## Files
- multi_hurricane_visualization_final.py: Main script to generate the visualization
- extract_hurricane_data.py: Script to extract relevant hurricane data from the large source file
- hurricane_data_extracted.csv: Smaller dataset containing only the relevant hurricane data
- multiple_hurricane_tracks_final.html: Output visualization file
- .gitignore: Configuration to exclude large files from version control
